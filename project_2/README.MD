Background: 
  Urban Ministires of Durham (UMD) was established in 1983. This organization works to end homelessness and provide aid to the homeless such as food, school supplies, clothes as well as many other services. In the first project I analyzed the amount of food given ( in pounds ) over a period of 11 years from 2008-2018 and did some data anlaysis. 
  
Goals: 
  My goal for this project was to build a shiny app which displays the amount of food per month for each given year from 2008-2018. This will allow the staff at UMD to visualize and see the trends on a month to month basis for every year over the past 11 years.
