Aim:

My goal for this project is to try and find trends and patterns that will assist UMD. For example, whether people with a certain disability tend to stay longer than those with no disability or some other disability. There is a lot of raw data and a lot of potential for different types of analysis. Because of this vast amount of data I am still unsure about what variables to focus on.
I decided to first just wrangle the data and do some basic plots in R for the demographics of the people who needed assitance for this rough draft. 

Looking forward, I plan on focusing my project and analysis more and try to focus on meanigful conclusions and results. This will take a lot of trial and error and time.
