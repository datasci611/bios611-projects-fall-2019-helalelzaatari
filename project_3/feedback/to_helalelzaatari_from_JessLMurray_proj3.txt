Impressions: 
	Your readme provides a solid overview of what you plan to do with the data, and sounds like it is focused on helping our client, UMD. I believe your second sentence is a fragment - "For example, whether people with a certain disability tend to stay longer than those with no disability or some other disability" should instead say something like "For example, I plan to investigate whether people with a certain disability tend to stay longer than those with no disability or some other disability."
	You have also included some code for wrangling your data both in Python and R - this meets the criteria for the project, and it looks like you've done some necessary cleaning with regards to the dates of service for UMD. Well done! I also like your ideas for plotting the distribution of demographic variables such as length of stay, age, and gender - these should be really useful for UMD! Overall, I think your project shows promise and I'm curious to see the final result.
	
Feedback Outline: 
1. project files are organized appropriately in directory but final readme does not include headers or sections; no Makefile yet
2. project uses both Python and R 
3. Docker is not used
4. histograms in R script will be appropriate for client
5. final files will need sections with headers and figures 
6. purpose is communicated in readme
7. purpose makes sense for client and should provide useful information on influence of demographic variables
8. data source is not fully explained; consider including background statement on UMD and the source of the files
9. interpretation is not yet added 
10. see number 9
11. take home statements/conclusions are not yet added.
