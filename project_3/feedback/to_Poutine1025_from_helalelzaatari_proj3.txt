1)Yes, the author included a Make file and it is working properly

2) Yes, the author used python and the pandas package in order to wrangle the data
and used R with tidyverse and ggplot.

3)Yes there is a docker file and it is working porperly.

4) Yes, the hypothesis was stated in the README as well as the points that was communicated
it would helpful to include some comments before the ggplot code as to what relationship or
hypothesis the author is trying to test. ( but it is obvious from the code what these hypothesis are
but this would help people no familiar with how R or python works)

5)The project is organized however, more comments should be added in all scripts.

6)Yes the purpose was communicated in the README as the author posed a question.

7)Yes, the client will definitely benefit from this data analysis as the author factors in various
demographics and variables into his analysis.

8)Yes the source was given the background of the interpretation. 

9)The purpose of the figures is clear if you see it. However, it would be useful to comment in some
interpretation at the end of each ggplot code.

10) There was no comments but it was clear by reading the code. Comments would be helpful here.

11) The take home messages are self-evident from the code. However, it would be better to add the take-home
message in the README or comment it at the end of the R code.
