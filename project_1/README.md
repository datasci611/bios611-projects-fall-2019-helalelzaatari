Main Goal:

- Help shelter allocate their resources and budget efficiently in order to help as many people as possible. 

- Help shelter with planning in the future when disasters occur such as recessions and hurricanes.


Brainstorm:

- clean data.

- Data comes from a 1999-2018 which is a 20 year period.


- Mostly interested in how resources such as food, food pounds, hygiene&school kits, diappers and clothing items quantities vary
over time on a monthly basis. Try to see if there are trends for example if there are particular months which are busier than others. This will help UMD with planning in the future. For example, I suspect that clothing items will be more in demand during
the winter.

- Do same analysis but on a yearly basis. Focus on growth rate and try to see if we can predict anything for the future years. Observe trends and interesting years and try to come up with a reason explaining these trends. For example, in 2008 there was an economic recession which lead to an increase in homelessness so we expect the number of people who needed help during that year to increase. 

- - This trend was observed in many shelters for example in Massachusetts reported a 32% increase between November 2007 and November 2008. In Connecticut family homeless shelter turned away 30 percent more families in September 2008 than in September 2007. In Minneapolis there was a reported 20 percent increase between the first 10 months of 2008 than in 2007.

- See whether analysis and trends are found in other similar studies. Look at differences and similarities. Try to explain observations and trends.

- Since hurricanes affect north carolina we want see the results of these natural disasters on resrouces needed. For example, how much do they increase percent of people in need of help? How much does severity of the hurricane affect this increase? How much more resources are needed after a hurricane?
